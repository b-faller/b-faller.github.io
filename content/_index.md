Hi, I'm Benjamin.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Science from the HTWG Konstanz.
Mostly I'm interested in infosec and computer science in general but in my free time I'm also an avid flight simulator enthusiast.

Recently, I've passed the OSCP exam, and now I'm currently learning for the OSWP while looking for a job as a pentester.

In the future you might find some articles by me on this site.
