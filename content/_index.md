Hi, I'm Benjamin.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Science from the HTWG Konstanz.
I'm currently working in infosec and interested in computer science in general but in my free time I'm also an avid flight simulator enthusiast.

In the future you might find some articles by me on this site.
