Hello, I'm Benjamin.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Science from HTWG Konstanz and currently work in the offensive information security space, with a focus on application security.
My professional interests span the broader field of computer science, while outside of work, I'm passionate about aviation.
Both fields allow me to take a deep dive into the technologies that surround us in everyday life, to which I hope to contribute with my work.

In the future you might find articles on this site covering topics at the intersection of my professional life and personal interests.

I currently maintain the following infosec related certifications:
